# Daemon
### *Computing 666*
<br>

How often do we compute 666 without anyone realizing it, and what would happen if we did it on purpose? Summon the Devil? Bad luck? Who knows!  Research needs to be done and done fast. On Unix systems a Daemon is a program that lies dormant until it's activated. Coded in C++ on Windows 10 using Visual Studio.  Daemon can run on both Windows and Linux.
