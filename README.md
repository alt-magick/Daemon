# Daemon
### Computing 666
# About
Coded in C++ on Windows 10 using Visual Studio.  A new version is planned to work on `NIX operating systems.
This project came out of wondering how often computer compute the number 666 without anyone realizing it, and what would happen if we did it on purpose. Summon the Devil? Bad luck? Who knows!  Research obviously needs to be done and done fast. On Unix a Daemon is a program that lies dormant until it's activated.
